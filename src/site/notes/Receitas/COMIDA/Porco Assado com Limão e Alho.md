1. - Make the marinade: Add the garlic, oil, oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, pepper, lemon juice and zest to a ziploc bag and mix it all together. Reserve half a cup of the marinade for the potatoes.
- Marinate the pork: Place the pork loin into the ziploc bag and toss with the marinade, making sure the pork is fully covered. Close the bag, and marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
- Prep the potatoes: In a roasting pan add the baby potatoes and toss with the reserved marinade. Arrange the potatoes around the sides of the roasting pan, making a whole in the middle, and place the pork loin in the center of the roasting pan. Pour remaining marinade over the pork.
- Bake: Preheat the oven to 375â„‰. Transfer the roasting pan to the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour. It should measure 145â„‰ on an instant read thermometer when done. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and let it rest, covered with foil, for 10 minutes before slicing into it.
